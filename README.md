# JUnit Testing
The repository contains a java code generated by AI which is further went under unit test by me to evaluate -
1. Code Quality
2. Good/Poor practices used by AI
3. Area of Improvement

I have used the JUnit framework to conduct unit testing on the java-code. The file includes 23 test cases to cover the following aspects -

• Ensuring correct code behaviour under “normal” conditions <br>
• Providing incorrect / extreme input <br>
• Exploring exception handling <br>
• Ensuring calculations are accurate <br>
• Exploring multiple example inputs <br>
• Evaluating all forms of input/output: Strings, calculations, getter/setter methods etc. <br>
• Exploring different combinations of (in)valid input <br>
• Testing multiple different logical paths through the program
